"Create a visually stunning and highly engaging travel website landing page using modern UI/UX principles. The design should be clean, well-structured, and mobile-friendly.

The website should include:

Hero Section: A full-width background image of an exotic travel destination, a captivating headline, a short description, and a bold call-to-action button.

Popular Destinations: A grid-based section featuring high-quality images of major travel destinations (e.g., New York, Paris, Tokyo), with brief descriptions.

Featured Hotels: Showcase luxury hotels with images, names, and descriptions highlighting their unique offerings.

Featured Activities: Display adventure activities such as hiking, diving, and sightseeing with engaging visuals and text.

About Us: A concise section introducing the company, its mission, and its team members with professional photos.

Contact Us: A simple and user-friendly contact form with fields for name, email, and message, plus contact details.

Gallery: A section displaying high-resolution travel images in a visually appealing layout.

Footer: Social media links, copyright notice, and contact details.

The design should use modern typography, a minimalistic color palette, smooth animations, and hover effects to enhance the user experience. It should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if needed) with a strong focus on responsiveness and fast loading speeds."
